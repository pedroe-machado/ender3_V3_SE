# ender3_V3_SE
###This is the repository where I organized the configuration files and calibration attempts for my 3D printer. 

Initially the model is natively Marlin, but I've flashed it to run on Klipper Firmware using a Orange PI as a server. If you are interested in how I did it, get in touch!

To begin, the repository may help with the firmware transition: https://github.com/dw-0/kiauh
